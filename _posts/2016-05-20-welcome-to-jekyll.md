## welcome to Jekyll!

### What is Jekyll?

It is a ___static___ ___site___ ___generator___

- **static:** No databases, nothing dynamically rendered on the server site, unlike php-based content management systems (e.g., Wordpress, Drupal, Omeka, Scalar).
- **site:**  Which begs the question: What constitutes a 'site' per se? A blog? A digital exhibit or collection? A scholarly edition? At what level of finished-ness? DH, especially in the classroom, often generates digital documentation and artifacts that resists conventional notions of 'websites', if such a term suggests a genre.
- **generator:** Or more specifically, a pre-processor. It processes the folders in a project according to highly customizable rules and outputs all the files (html, css, scripts, images) into a single folder. In other words, everything necessary to create a standalone site.

However, as a tool, it was designed to meet the needs of single author blogs. It takes some imagination to re-see the tool as a meaningful tool for collaboration.

## a few notes on basic editing & structure of Jekyll

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
