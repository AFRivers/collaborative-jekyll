For several reasons, at our school, we have prioritized developing new projects as static sites, which has forced us to address the obvious shortcoming of such technologies: working with multiple contributors. In this workshp we will explore a stack geared towards collaboration. Our current model, based on github, prose.io and Jekyll, allows us to get student and faculty involvement with minimal technical barrier. On a practical level, this stack is easily reproducible since relatively few resources are required. 

Participants will leave the workshop knowing how to setup the stack, collaborate and have a site ready for deployment through github-pages with a specific URL.
