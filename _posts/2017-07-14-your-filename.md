## Stewart's Post

Digital Humanities is the umbrella term that is often used to describe much of this work.
It is neither a field, nor a discipline nor a methodology. It is not simply the humanities
done with computers nor is it simply computer science performed on topics of interest to
the humanities. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialog between emerging
technology and humanistic inquiry. For some, it is a scholarly community of practice that
is engaged in a wide variety of projects but who collectively value experimentation,
collaboration and making. For others, it is a contentious label that signifies elitism and is
characterized by a fetishization of technology and a lack of critical reflection. However it
is defined, digital humanities has had a significant impact on the academic landscape
for more than a decade.
